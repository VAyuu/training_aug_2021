 ===================================================
 
 1) Make a StandAlone Class if its not passing "is a" relationship
    with any other class in your project other than Object class
    
2) Make a Subclass if it passes "is a" relationship with any existing
   class and you want to add more attributes or methods or override any
   existing methods
   
3) Create a abstract class to provide a template for a group of classes
   same attributes or same methods
   
4) Create a Interface to provide additional behaviours (methods) for 
   a group of classes in different hierarchy.
